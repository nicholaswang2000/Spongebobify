## How to use

First way to use is to open the popup window when you click on the extension in the browser. This prompts a window for you to copy and paste the text you need spongebobified:

<img src="./images/popup.png" width=40%>

Second way to use is to highlight whatever text you need spongebobified, right-clicking, then selecting "Spongebobify" through the Chrome context menu as such:

<span>
<img src="./images/before.png" width=30%>
<img src="./images/during.png" width=30%>
<img src="./images/after.png" width=30%>
  </span>
